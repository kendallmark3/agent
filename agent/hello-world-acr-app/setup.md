Got it! Here's a clean, step-by-step **developer-friendly Markdown guide** for building and running your FastAPI app in Docker with Azure ACR (or locally).

# FastAPI Docker App - Developer Guide

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed and running  
- Python 3.11 (for local dev, optional)  
- Basic knowledge of FastAPI and Docker commands  

---

## 1. Create your FastAPI app

Create a file named `main.py` with the following content:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, world from Azure ACR!"}
````

---

## 2. Create a Dockerfile

Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the same folder with this content:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY main.py .

# Install dependencies without cache
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir fastapi uvicorn

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

---

## 3. Build your Docker image

Run this command in the directory with your `Dockerfile` and `main.py`:

```bash
docker build -t fastapi-app .
```

---

## 4. Run your Docker container locally

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 fastapi-app
```

Open your browser or curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

You should get:

```json
{"message":"Hello, world from Azure ACR!"}
```

---

## 5. (Optional) Push your image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)

### Login to your Azure account

```bash
az login
```

### Login to your Azure Container Registry

```bash
az acr login --name <your-acr-name>
```

### Tag your image

```bash
docker tag fastapi-app <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/fastapi-app:latest
```

### Push your image

```bash
docker push <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/fastapi-app:latest
```

---

## Troubleshooting

* If you see `RuntimeError: can't start new thread`, make sure your FastAPI route handlers use `async def` to avoid thread creation.
* Use `pip install --no-cache-dir` in Dockerfile to reduce image size and avoid caching issues.
* Update pip inside the container if needed with:

```bash
RUN python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

## Summary

* Use `async def` for FastAPI routes in container environments with thread limits.
* Keep your Dockerfile simple and install only what you need.
* Test locally before pushing to ACR or other registries.
